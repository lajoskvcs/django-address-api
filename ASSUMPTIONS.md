# Assumptions

## Rest
I used Django rest framework, because it is widely used in Django community.

## Api documentation
I wanted to support Swagger and Redoc. According to my python knowledge, [drf-yasg](https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the recommended.

## Authentication
For authentication, I decided to go with JWT. THe only headache is the server-side logout.
